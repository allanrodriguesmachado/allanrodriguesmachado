## Hey There! ðŸ‘‹


I'm a junior front-end developer.

I've been studying the front end a lot, using React js and its entire ecosystem.

I currently work as a junior full stack developer. I work with building web systems, APIs and systems integration, mainly using technologies such as PHP/Laminas, Composer, Git/Github, PostgreSQL, Jquery and Boostrap.
